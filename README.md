# Non-Euclidean Chess

In the game of Chess, pawns can advance to the eighth rank and promote to a queen.
In Non-Euclidean Chess, there's another way to upgrade pieces, but it's not what you're used to.
If a piece goes through a portal, it can come out the other side onto the same board but twice the size,
because the exit portal is twice as large as the entry portal, and thus it stretches the piece.

Big pieces can capture four small pieces in a single move.

If you go the other direction, you can end up with a tiny piece.
What can a tiny piece do? I don't know. It can hide.

What if the exit portal is wider than the entry portal?
You get a wide piece, taking up 2x1 space.

If you've ever played [Problem Sleuth], this should be no problem for you.
